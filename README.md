# Cats-on-the-Brain

A memory game with a little twist.

Cats on the Brain is a 2-player Memory Game where three rounds are played, and the best two out of three wins the game. At the end of each round, the cards will randomize to start the next round.

What determines the winner of a round is the player who finds all matching cards with the least amount of tries. The twist is that there are three bonus cards in the mix. One bonus card is an Instant Winner card; if selected, the player automatically wins that round. Another bonus card is an Instant Loser card; if selected, the player automatically loses that round. And the last bonus card is a Wild Card; this card will automatically match with any card you select next (if chosen as the first card) or will automatically match with the card previously selected (if chosen as the second card).
