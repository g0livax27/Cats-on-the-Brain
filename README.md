A Memory Game against the Computer.

You're given 5 moves and you must find all the matching cards before you run out of moves, otherwise you lose.

The twist is that there are three bonus cards in the mix:

One bonus card is an Instant Winner card; if selected, you win.

Another bonus card is an Instant Loser card; if selected, you lose.

And the last bonus card is a Wild Card; this card will match with any card you select next (if chosen as the first card) or will match with the card previously selected (if chosen as the second card).
