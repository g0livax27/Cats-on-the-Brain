A Memory Game against the Computer.

You're given 7 moves and you must find 3 matching cards before you run out of moves, otherwise you lose.

The twist is that there are three bonus cards in the mix:

Instant Winner card: if selected, you win.

Instant Loser card: if selected, you lose.

Wild Card: this card will match with any card you select next (if chosen as the first card) or will match with the card previously selected (if chosen as the second card).
